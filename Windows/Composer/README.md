# Setup Composer for Windows

Before installing Composer, just make sure you have added PHP to the path.<br>
If you haven't, click <a href="../Adding php and mysql to Path/" >here</a> to know more.

### Step 1 

Download Composer for Windows from the official website by clicking 
<a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br>

The installer will download composer for you and set up your _PATH_ environment variable so you can simply call composer from any directory. <br>

Download and run Composer-Setup.exe - it will install the latest composer version whenever it is executed.<br>

### Step 2

Like I have said before in the README of this repository, I will be installing stuff to a specific folder in C drive.<br>
So, in C drive, there is a folder with the name LEO.<br>

      C:\LEO

<br>

<hr>

### Step 3
 
Click on the downloaded application.<br>

<br>

Since, I am the only person who is going to use my PC, I will be installing it for all the users.<br>

You might see a warning like this.<br>
This is just your PC trying to keep you safe.<br>
Just click _Yes_ or _Allow_, whatever is showing up on your PC.<br>

### Step 4

I am going to choose the Developer Mode. <br>

### Step 6

If you have added PHP to path correctly, this option would be filled like this by default.<br>

![php](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/composer/img/05.png)

<br>

Click  *Next*.

So, just click _Next_ and proceed. <br>

### Step 10

I don't want to view online documentation, so I am unselecting that option. <br>
Click _Finish_.<br>

![install](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/composer/img/11.png)

### Step 11

To check if the installation is done properly, open command prompt and type the following. <br>

      composer --version

<br>

You must be something similar to this. <br>
